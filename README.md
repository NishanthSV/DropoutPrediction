# DropoutPrediction
  It is a machine learning project to predict whether a student will drop out of college based on the financial and performance of the student. An institution cannot provide scholarships or fee reductions to all students. If we predict a student who has high performance in their studies but is not able to continue his studies because of financial problems. So we can easily identify the students and the college can provide scholarships to them.

  I have categorized the features into two types. One is Financial features which include all their expenditure like Parent's annual income, College Fees, Hostel fees, Bus fees, etc. Another one is Performance Features which includes academic details like CGPA, Any backlogs, Internal marks, Attendance etc.

  Since it is a classification problem, I tried many classification models. Primarily I used the Random Forest classifier which gave 95 percent accuracy , Experimentation on other models such as Logistic regression, Naive bayes classifier gave 75 and 70 percent accuracy.
