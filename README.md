# DropoutPrediction
Student Dropout prediction system

		It is basically a machine learning project to predict whether a student will dropout from college based on financial and perfomance of the student.

	Basically , a college cannot provide scholarship or fee reduction to all students. If we predict a student who has high perfomance in studies but not able to continue his studies because of financial problems. So we can easily identify the students and the college can provide scholarship to them.


	I have categorized the features into two types. One is Financial features which includes all their expenditure like Parent's annual income , College Fees , Hostel fees , Bus fees etc. Another one is Perfomance Features which includes acadamic details like CGPA , Any backlogs , Internal marks , Attendance etc.

	Since it is a classification problem , I tried many classification models . Primarily I used Random Forest classifier which gave 75 percent accuracy , I also tried other models such as Logistic regression , Naive bayes classifier which have 75 and 70 percent accuracy.
